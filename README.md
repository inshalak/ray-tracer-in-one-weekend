It's a Sunday so probably not a weekend but maybe this week?

## Part 1: Outputting an Image
This pretty much ended up being me re-writing Shirley's code and doing a deepdive into PPM as an image format. This first commit adds in some basic support to output the image in two diff file formats if required (png, jpeg) using the  `libpng`. I've commented out the code to just standardize to Shirley's as I move forward tho. 

I've also added in comments to explain every line as if I am a 5 year old - just because I have the retention capacity of a goldfish.
